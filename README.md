# Poober
This repository contains a full-stack enterprise level application built on top of SpringBoot and QT frameworks, which can be deployed to IoT devices as a Yocto projec. It was created as a course project for Application Development Environments (VIAUAC04) at Budapest University of Technology and Economics.

## Technical stack, functionalities

- Yocto project based server or client (once per homework)
- QML-based graphical user interface (including at least one graph or other drawing, one list, and one menu)
- REST API (including new data creation, query, data modification, with logically structured URLs)
- Support for multiple users, authentication and different roles.
- Create a device driver under Linux
- Servers communicating with asynchronous message queues (i.e. multiple backend components).
- Using Java Persistence API with at least 5 classes.
- Use of Spring Data
- Dependency injection based on Spring
- Appropriate security precautions (authorization, SQL injection prevention, server-side validation, secure password storage, etc.)
- Use logging mechanism with loglevel support. Bonus tasks that may require extra follow-up (with maximum points available only if at least 30 points from the basic tasks are accumulated in time):
- Create a Linux installation package
- Scheduled tasks in the backend.
- Create an interrupt handler under Linux
- Sending emails in the backend.
- Use QRC mechanism to store and access non-QML files.
